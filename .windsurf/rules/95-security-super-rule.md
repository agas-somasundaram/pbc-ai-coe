# Security Super Rule (Master Rule)

This rule binds ALL security rules (60–99) together.

The model must:
- Perform continuous security scanning of logic, patterns, dependencies.
- Flag any insecure code automatically.
- Enforce secure defaults without requiring user prompting.
- Reject unsafe implementations and propose corrected versions.
