# Project Rules Entry Point

1. Always load and respect all rules in `.windsurf/rules/`.
2. If any rule here conflicts with global rules, the security rules take priority.
3. Security scanning is ALWAYS active during coding, planning, or reviewing.
4. When coding, continuously evaluate:
   - Dependency risk
   - Known CVEs
   - Insecure patterns
   - Secret exposure
   - Attack vectors relevant to the file being edited
